When we focus exclusively on the technology we sometimes miss the real goal, which is managing the risk to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information the technology supports.  In my new role, I hope to continue shaping the cybersecurity conversation from a technology-focus to one that focuses and aligns to risk management best practices.\" – Greg J.
